# M4-Sudoku-Solver

## Goal
Build a Sudoku Solver.
If there is any time left, a program to create a Sudoku could also be added.

## Why is it useful?
This project will help me take a closer look at arrays and address any gaps in my understanding.
I will learn about backtracking and how to optimise an algorithm. Since this is my first solo project, 
it will push me to solve problems independently rather than relying on group members for solutions 
or asking them to do it for me.
Sudoku-solving is an engaging task, making the development of an algorithm for it an interesting challenge.

## Implementation
The algorithm will solve the Sudoku using a trial-and-error approach. It will attempt to fill the grid 
by placing numbers 1 to 9 in empty cells, backtracking whenever it encounters an invalid state.
