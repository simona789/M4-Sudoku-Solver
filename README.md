# M4-Sudoku-Solver

## What the project does?

This program can solve any given Sudoku as well as create a new Sudoku grid. It can 
handle Sudokus with more than one solution, which means it does not strictly qualify 
as a “true” Sudoku solver.

## Why the project is useful?

This project helped me deepen my understanding of arrays and address any gaps in 
my knowledge.
I learned about backtracking and how to optimize algorithms. Since this was my first 
solo project, it encouraged me to solve problems independently instead of relying on 
group members for solutions or delegating tasks to others.

## How users can get started with the project?

In the file Sudoku.java, you will find three different examples of how to use this 
Sudoku program:

	1.	Input a pre-made Sudoku as a 2D integer array.
	2.	Create your own Sudoku using the generator.
	3.	Generate and solve a Sudoku simultaneously.

If you only want to generate a Sudoku, you can do so by running the main function in the 
Generator file.
